# DCAGGCN: A Novel Method for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Bearings
 
---
 
## 📚 Project Overview
 
The goal of this project is to produce reproducible results in condition monitoring. In this project, we propose a dual correlation adaptive gated graph convolutional network (DCAGGCN) that addresses the problem of predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of bearings based on graph neural networks. We apply the method with a publicly available dataset and show the results using code.

## 📊 Datasets
 
DCAGGCN is validated using the following publicly available datasets:
 
- **PHM2012**: A dataset commonly used for bearing RUL prediction research.
- **XJTU-SY**: Another popular dataset for evaluating bearing degradation models.
 
Detailed instructions on how to download and preprocess these datasets will be provided in the project documentation.
