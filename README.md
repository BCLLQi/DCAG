# DCAGGCN: A Novel Method for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Bearings
 
---
 
## ðŸ“š Project Overview
 
DCAGGCN (Deep Convolutional Attention Graph Convolutional Network) is an innovative deep learning approach designed to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of bearings. By integrating the strengths of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Attention Graph Convolutional Networks (GAT-GCN), DCAGGCN precisely models the degradation process of bearings by mining spatial and temporal features in time-series data.

## ðŸ“Š Datasets
 
DCAGGCN is validated using the following publicly available datasets:
 
- **PHM2012**: A dataset commonly used for bearing RUL prediction research.
- **Xi'an Jiaotong University Bearing Dataset**: Another popular dataset for evaluating bearing degradation models.
 
Detailed instructions on how to download and preprocess these datasets will be provided in the project documentation.
