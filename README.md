DCAGGCN: A Novel Method for Remaining Useful Life Prediction of Bearings
Description
The goal of this project is to produce reproducible results in experiments. In this project, we address the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction problem based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our method is applied to publicly available datasets, and the results are demonstrated using the provided code.
